-clone icon-exclaim repository
-modify the spack recipes, e.g. jsbach needs to be activated
-compile it
-replace icon binary in gpu build with wrapper which sets GT4PY_BUILD_CACHE_DIR individual for each task (maybe not)
-clone EXCLAIM_coupled_setup repository
-modify experiments/exp.EXCLAIM_COUPLED.run
  +comment out #SBATCH --uenv=icon/25.2:v3:/user-environment
               #SBATCH --view=default
   the uenv should not be loaded in the slurm script but only before outside the scripts

   before the run_model line, special attention has to be payed with Python two separate installations have to be used for preprocessing and the dsl since none of them contains all packages
-use modified files coupling.yaml namelists.sh settings_R02B07-R02B07.sh in the experiments directory
-run the model with the run_aj.sh script
